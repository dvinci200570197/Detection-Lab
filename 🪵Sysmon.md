    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>15</strong></td>
      <td>File Create Stream Hash</td>
      <td>Captures creation of alternate data streams, often used to hide data or code.</td>

      <td>Logs changes to the Sysmon configuration. Important for detecting unauthorized modifications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>17</strong></td>
      <td>Pipe Created</td>
      <td>Indicates when a named pipe is created. Useful for detecting inter-process communication channels used by malware.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>18</strong></td>
      <td>Pipe Connected</td>
      <td>Logs when a process connects to a named pipe. Helps monitor IPC mechanisms.</td>
